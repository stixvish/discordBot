# what is this?

this is a discord bot, meant to make fun of my friends and do a little bit of server management so that server owners can know what goes on within their servers when they are not on.

## what can this bot do?

this bot can show funny pictures of my friends, and potentially new people with some editing.
it can react to messages with certain phrases inside of them.
it can censor words that you don't want inside your server, and delete the messages containing them if they come up.
it can also lay a flurry of insults on people if you ask it to.

## what about server management?

it can log messages, and show if there are attachments or embeds in a message
it can show if a message was deleted and the attachments that it contains
it can show if a message was edited, the message before and after.
